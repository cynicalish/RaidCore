    Fix typo in ohmna, clean up some dead code, refs #68
    
    This commit fixes a typo for Ohmna. This might be the cause for the
    pillar timer not working, but still needs testing if it's fully fixed
    with this.
    Also removes call to StopScan() since we no longer use this.

    Fix call to StopBar() with incorrect key
    
    This commit fixes an issue with Kuralak where the StopBar() parameter
    was the translation string, and not the actual key we used earlier when
    adding the bar.

    Fix world marker displayed on units not on screen, closes #90
    
    Previously we had already fixed the issue where world markers were
    displayed on the wrong location on the screen when the position
    coordinates were not on our screen. This commit extends that
    functionality to marking of units as well.

    Add option to decline summons, refs #100
    
    Raid leaders and assistants can force people to accept pending summons
    via /raidc summon.
    This will allow people to override that option in the settings, so
    summons are no longer automatically accepted.

    Fix / Improve System Daemons World Markers
    
    System Daemons still had calls to the old method of World Markers so
    they didn't work at all. This commit fixes that issue. It also
    improves/reduces the code a bit by placing the markers via a loop
    instead of separate calls.

    Fix an issue that prevented OnReset() from working
    
    The RAID_WIPE event was fired after the encounter was disabled, at that
    point it doesn't work so OnReset() was never called. Since this is
    required for some fights, I moved the event handler so it fires before
    disabling the module.
    
    This was an issue specifically on Avatus, where it only worked the first
    pull, until another reloadui happened.
