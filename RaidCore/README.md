RaidCore
================

Raidcore is a Wildstar addon. It is a boss-mods addon intended to aid with fights in GA/DS.

RaidCore is a work in progress, some bosses are buggy or may not be fully accurate.
Most DS bosses are fully functional, except for Avatus which is a WIP and some elemental pairs that are semi-functional, depending on the combination.
Please open an issue if you notice problems.

The addon will not be placed on Curse until it is more complete.

The addon was originally made by Ninjouz of Eugenic but has since been taken over by me (KamiNuvini).
